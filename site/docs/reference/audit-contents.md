### What auditors look for: Section-by-section checklist

#### 📋 Report Header (5 seconds)

**Critical checks**:

- ✅ Model ID matches registry entry
- ✅ Timestamp is recent (not stale analysis)
- ✅ Compliance profile matches regulatory requirement (e.g., SR 11-7 for credit)
- ✅ Author/submitter identified

**Red flags**:

- ❌ Missing model identifier
- ❌ Timestamp >6 months old
- ❌ Wrong compliance profile for use case
- ❌ No contact information

**Typical auditor question**: "Is this the same model deployed in production?"

---

#### 📊 Performance Section (30 seconds)

**Critical checks**:

- ✅ Accuracy >80% (banking/insurance standard)
- ✅ AUC-ROC >0.80 (discrimination ability)
- ✅ Confusion matrix shows acceptable error rates
- ✅ Test set size n≥1000 (statistical validity)

**Red flags**:

- ❌ Accuracy <70% (model not production-ready)
- ❌ AUC-ROC <0.70 (barely better than random)
- ❌ High false negative rate (missed good customers)
- ❌ Test set <100 samples (not statistically valid)

**Typical auditor questions**:

- "What's the cost of false positives vs false negatives?"
- "How does this compare to the baseline?"
- "Was this evaluated on held-out data?"

**What they're really checking**: Is the model accurate enough to justify its complexity and potential bias risks?

---

#### ⚖️ Fairness Section (2 minutes - most scrutinized)

**Critical checks**:

- ✅ Demographic parity <10% (ECOA standard for credit)
- ✅ Equal opportunity <10% (qualified applicants treated equally)
- ✅ Group sample sizes n≥30 (statistical validity)
- ✅ Statistical significance documented (p-values)
- ✅ Protected attributes identified (race, gender, age)

**Red flags**:

- ❌ Disparity >10% without business justification
- ❌ Sample size <30 for any group (unreliable)
- ❌ No intersectional analysis (single-attribute only)
- ❌ Missing statistical tests (could be sampling noise)
- ❌ Protected attributes used as model inputs (illegal for credit)

**Typical auditor questions**:

- "Why is there a 12% disparity in equal opportunity?"
- "What's the business justification for this difference?"
- "Have you tested intersectional bias (e.g., Black women)?"
- "What mitigation steps were attempted?"

**What they're really checking**: Does this model systematically disadvantage protected groups? If yes, can you justify it?

**Regulatory thresholds**:

- **ECOA/FCRA (Credit)**: <10% disparity in approval rates
- **EEOC (Employment)**: 80% rule (20% relative difference)
- **GDPR Article 22**: No automated decision if discriminatory
- **EU AI Act**: High-risk systems must demonstrate fairness testing

---

#### 🔍 Explainability Section (1 minute)

**Critical checks**:

- ✅ Top features make business sense (not spurious correlations)
- ✅ No protected attributes in top 10 (race, gender, etc.)
- ✅ Explainer method documented (TreeSHAP, Coefficients, etc.)
- ✅ Sample explanations provided (3-5 representative cases)
- ✅ Feature contributions sum to prediction (additivity property)

**Red flags**:

- ❌ Top feature is zip code (proxy for race)
- ❌ Protected attributes appear in feature importance
- ❌ Explainer method not documented
- ❌ Explanations don't match business logic
- ❌ SHAP values don't satisfy additivity

**Typical auditor questions**:

- "Why is 'first name' the #2 most important feature?" (gender proxy)
- "Can you explain this specific denial to the applicant?"
- "How do you know these explanations are accurate?"

**What they're really checking**: Are the model's reasons legitimate business factors, or is it learning to discriminate via proxies?

**Regulatory requirements**:

- **SR 11-7**: Model must be explainable to validators
- **ECOA**: Adverse action notices must cite specific reasons
- **GDPR Article 22**: Right to explanation for automated decisions
- **EU AI Act**: High-risk systems must provide explanations

---

#### 🎯 Calibration Section (30 seconds)

**Critical checks**:

- ✅ Expected Calibration Error (ECE) <0.05 (well-calibrated)
- ✅ Calibration curve close to diagonal (predicted = actual)
- ✅ Brier score reported (lower is better)
- ✅ Confidence intervals provided (statistical uncertainty)

**Red flags**:

- ❌ ECE >0.10 (poorly calibrated)
- ❌ Calibration curve far from diagonal (over/under-confident)
- ❌ No confidence intervals (can't assess reliability)
- ❌ Calibration not tested per group (could be calibrated overall but not within groups)

**Typical auditor questions**:

- "If the model says 80% probability, is it right 80% of the time?"
- "Is calibration consistent across demographic groups?"

**What they're really checking**: Can we trust the model's confidence scores for high-stakes decisions?

**Why calibration matters**:

- **Insurance pricing**: Premiums based on predicted probabilities
- **Credit scoring**: Interest rates tied to default probability
- **Healthcare**: Treatment decisions based on risk scores

---

#### 🔒 Reproducibility Manifest (15 seconds)

**Critical checks**:

- ✅ Config hash provided (can reproduce exact run)
- ✅ Data hash provided (tamper detection)
- ✅ Random seeds documented (all sources of randomness)
- ✅ Package versions listed (environment reproducibility)
- ✅ Git commit SHA provided (exact code version)

**Red flags**:

- ❌ No config hash (can't verify exact settings)
- ❌ No random seeds (non-reproducible)
- ❌ Missing package versions (environment drift risk)
- ❌ No git commit (can't inspect source code)
- ❌ Timestamp mismatch (manifest generated at different time)

**Typical auditor questions**:

- "Can I reproduce this audit byte-for-byte?"
- "What happens if I run this again?"
- "How do I know this data wasn't tampered with?"

**What they're really checking**: Is this audit trustworthy? Can it be independently validated?

**Regulatory requirements**:

- **SR 11-7**: Model validation must be reproducible
- **FDA (Medical Devices)**: Clinical validation must be reproducible
- **EU AI Act**: High-risk systems must maintain audit trails

### Common auditor questions by role

#### Compliance officer (regulatory risk)

1. "Does this pass our fairness thresholds?" → Check Fairness Section
2. "Can we defend this to CFPB/EEOC/FDA?" → Check Fairness + Explainability
3. "Is there documentation for legal?" → Check Manifest + Config Hash
4. "What's our exposure if we deploy this?" → Check Red Flags across all sections

#### Model validator (technical verification)

1. "Is the accuracy acceptable?" → Check Performance Section
2. "Are the explanations correct?" → Check Explainability + SHAP additivity
3. "Can I reproduce this?" → Check Manifest + Seeds + Hashes
4. "What are the model limitations?" → Check Sample Sizes + Confidence Intervals

#### Risk manager (business impact)

1. "What error rate can we tolerate?" → Check Confusion Matrix + Cost Analysis
2. "Which demographic groups are affected?" → Check Fairness Group Breakdown
3. "What's the worst-case scenario?" → Check Maximum Disparity + Regulatory Thresholds
4. "Do we need to retrain or mitigate?" → Check FAIL flags + Justifications

#### External auditor/regulator (independent verification)

1. "Show me the evidence pack." → Manifest + Config + Data Hashes
2. "Can you reproduce this in front of me?" → Seeds + Git Commit + Package Versions
3. "Explain this 12% fairness violation." → Fairness Section + Business Justification
4. "Why should I trust these explanations?" → Explainer Documentation + Validation

### How to use this guide

**Before submitting an audit**:

1. Go through each section with the auditor checklist
2. Mark ✅ for items that pass, ❌ for items that fail
3. Prepare justifications for any ❌ red flags
4. Ensure Manifest section is complete (reproducibility is critical)

**When reviewing someone else's audit**:

1. Start with Fairness Section (highest regulatory risk)
2. Check Manifest (can you reproduce it?)
3. Validate Performance (is accuracy acceptable?)
4. Review Explainability (do reasons make sense?)
5. Verify Calibration (can you trust probabilities?)

**For regulatory submission**:

1. Generate evidence pack (PDF + Manifest + Config + Hashes)
2. Prepare 1-page summary for compliance officer
3. Document all red flags with justifications
4. Include independent validator sign-off
5. Archive for retention period (typically 7 years)
