# Compliance Officer Workflow

Guide for compliance officers, risk managers, and regulatory liaisons using GlassAlpha to generate audit evidence and communicate with regulators.

## Overview

This guide is for compliance professionals who need to:

- Generate audit evidence for regulator submissions
- Verify model documentation completeness
- Establish policy gates for automated compliance checks
- Communicate audit results to examiners and auditors
- Maintain audit trails and reproducibility

**Not an ML engineer?** This guide assumes minimal technical background. For implementation details, see [ML Engineer Workflow](ml-engineer-workflow.md).

## Key Capabilities

### Evidence Pack Generation

Create tamper-evident zip files containing:

- Audit PDF report
- Provenance manifest (hashes, versions, seeds)
- Policy decision log (pass/fail for each compliance gate)
- Configuration files
- Dataset schema

**Use case**: Regulator requests model documentation for SR 11-7 audit or fair lending review.

### Policy-as-Code Gates

Define compliance thresholds in YAML files:

- Minimum calibration accuracy
- Maximum fairness metric values
- Required sample sizes
- Robustness requirements

**Use case**: Establish firm-wide model acceptance criteria that automatically fail non-compliant models.

### Verification Workflow

Independent validators can verify audit integrity:

- Checksum validation (SHA256)
- Manifest completeness
- Reproducibility checks

**Use case**: Internal audit or third-party validation of model documentation.

## Typical Workflows

### Workflow 1: Generating Evidence for Regulator Submission

**Scenario**: Federal Reserve examiner requests SR 11-7 documentation for your credit scoring model.

#### Step 1: Request audit from ML team

Provide ML team with compliance requirements:

```yaml
# Requirements for compliance review
audit_profile: "sr_11_7_banking"
strict_mode: true # Enforce determinism
policy_gates: "configs/policy/sr_11_7_banking.yaml"

# Required sections
fairness_analysis: true
calibration_testing: true
reason_codes: true
recourse_analysis: true
```

**What to communicate to ML team**:

- "We need SR 11-7 documentation for the Q4 credit model"
- "Use strict mode to ensure reproducibility"
- "Apply sr_11_7_banking policy gates"
- "Audit must pass all error-level gates"

#### Step 2: Review audit report

ML team provides `credit_model_audit_2025Q4.pdf` and `credit_model_audit_2025Q4.manifest.json`.

**Review checklist**:

- [ ] All sections present (model card, performance, fairness, calibration, explainability)
- [ ] Protected attributes analyzed (race, gender, age)
- [ ] Statistical significance documented (confidence intervals, sample sizes)
- [ ] Limitations section lists assumptions and edge cases
- [ ] Provenance manifest includes git SHA, package versions, data hashes
- [ ] Policy gates documented with pass/fail status

**Red flags**:

- Missing sections or "N/A" without explanation
- Small group sample sizes (n < 30)
- Wide confidence intervals (statistical power issues)
- Failed policy gates without documented mitigation
- Missing reproducibility information (no seed, no versions)

#### Step 3: Generate evidence pack

Once audit passes review, create evidence pack:

```bash
glassalpha export-evidence-pack \
  --audit reports/credit_model_audit_2025Q4.pdf \
  --output evidence_packs/credit_model_2025Q4.zip
```

**Evidence pack contents**:

```
credit_model_2025Q4.zip
├── credit_model_audit_2025Q4.pdf
├── credit_model_audit_2025Q4.manifest.json
├── policy_decision.json
├── checksums.txt (SHA256 hashes)
├── config/
│   ├── audit_config.yaml
│   ├── policy_gates.yaml
│   └── data_schema.yaml
└── README.txt (verification instructions)
```

#### Step 4: Submit to regulator

Include evidence pack in submission with cover letter:

**Example cover letter language**:

> "Model documentation was generated using GlassAlpha v0.1.0, an open-source audit framework. The attached evidence pack contains a comprehensive audit report addressing SR 11-7 requirements (Sections III.A through V), including model validation testing, fairness analysis, and outcomes monitoring.
>
> All artifacts in the evidence pack are checksummed for integrity verification. Independent validation can be performed using the included verification instructions. The provenance manifest documents all random seeds, package versions, and data hashes for full reproducibility."

### Workflow 2: Establishing Policy Gates

**Scenario**: Your firm needs standardized model acceptance criteria for all credit models.

#### Step 1: Define compliance requirements

Work with legal, risk, and compliance teams to establish thresholds:

**Example requirements**:

- Calibration error < 5% (SR 11-7 III.B.1)
- Demographic parity difference < 10% (ECOA, fair lending)
- Equalized odds difference < 15% (ECOA, fair lending)
- Minimum group size ≥ 30 (statistical power)
- Robustness to demographic shift < 5% degradation (SR 11-7 III.A.3)

#### Step 2: Create policy configuration

Document requirements in YAML:

```yaml
# configs/policy/firm_credit_baseline.yaml
policy_name: "Firm Credit Model Baseline"
version: "1.0"
effective_date: "2025-10-01"
citation: "SR 11-7, ECOA, internal risk policy"

gates:
  - name: "Calibration Quality"
    clause: "SR 11-7 III.B.1"
    metric: "expected_calibration_error"
    threshold: 0.05
    comparison: "less_than"
    severity: "error" # Blocks deployment

  - name: "Demographic Parity"
    clause: "ECOA fair lending"
    metric: "demographic_parity_difference"
    threshold: 0.10
    comparison: "less_than"
    severity: "error"

  - name: "Equalized Odds"
    clause: "ECOA fair lending"
    metric: "equalized_odds_difference"
    threshold: 0.15
    comparison: "less_than"
    severity: "warning" # Requires documentation

  - name: "Minimum Statistical Power"
    clause: "SR 11-7 III.B.2"
    metric: "min_group_size"
    threshold: 30
    comparison: "greater_than"
    severity: "error"
```

**Severity levels**:

- `error`: Model cannot be deployed (CI fails, exit code 1)
- `warning`: Requires documentation but doesn't block deployment
- `info`: Tracked for monitoring, no action required

#### Step 3: Apply to all audits

ML engineers reference policy in audit configs:

```yaml
# Standard audit config
audit_profile: "sr_11_7_banking"
policy_gates: "configs/policy/firm_credit_baseline.yaml"
strict_mode: true
```

When audit runs, policy gates are checked:

```bash
glassalpha audit --config audit.yaml --output report.pdf

# Exit codes:
# 0 = All gates passed
# 1 = One or more error-level gates failed
# 2 = Runtime error
```

#### Step 4: Monitor compliance

Track gate failures across model portfolio:

```bash
# Query all audits in registry
glassalpha registry list --failed-gates

# Output: Models that failed any gate
model_id | gate_name | metric_value | threshold | status
credit_v2 | Demographic Parity | 0.12 | 0.10 | FAILED
fraud_v5  | Calibration Quality | 0.08 | 0.05 | FAILED
```

**Action items for failures**:

- FAILED gates: Model must be retrained or threshold adjusted
- WARNING gates: Document mitigation strategy in model card
- INFO gates: Monitor for trends, no immediate action

### Workflow 3: Responding to Audit Findings

**Scenario**: Internal audit or regulator identifies concern about fairness metrics.

#### Step 1: Reproduce audit results

Verify audit is reproducible:

```bash
# Verify evidence pack integrity
glassalpha verify-evidence-pack \
  --input evidence_packs/credit_model_2025Q4.zip

# Output:
# ✓ All checksums valid
# ✓ Manifest complete
# ✓ Policy gates documented
# ✓ Reproducibility info present
```

If checksums match, audit is tamper-evident.

#### Step 2: Investigate specific finding

Example finding: "Demographic parity difference of 0.12 exceeds 0.10 threshold for gender."

**Investigation steps**:

1. Review fairness section of audit PDF (Section 7)
2. Check sample sizes per group (are groups balanced?)
3. Review confidence intervals (is difference statistically significant?)
4. Check for proxy features (features correlated with gender)

**Questions to ask ML team**:

- "What is the confidence interval for this metric?" (0.12 ± 0.03 vs 0.12 ± 0.10)
- "What features are most correlated with the protected attribute?"
- "What is the baseline disparity in the training data?" (model vs data bias)

#### Step 3: Document mitigation or remediation

**If finding is valid**:

Option A: Retrain model with fairness constraints
Option B: Adjust decision threshold (if permissible)
Option C: Remove proxy features and retest

**If finding is statistical artifact**:

Document in response:

> "Demographic parity difference of 0.12 has a 95% confidence interval of [0.08, 0.16], overlapping with the 0.10 threshold. Sample size of n=150 for the minority group results in wide confidence intervals. With increased sample size, we expect the metric to stabilize within policy bounds. We will monitor this metric in ongoing validation."

#### Step 4: Update audit and resubmit

After mitigation, generate new audit:

```bash
glassalpha audit \
  --config audit.yaml \
  --output credit_model_audit_2025Q4_v2.pdf
```

Compare old vs new:

```bash
# Extract key metrics
glassalpha inspect --audit report_v1.pdf --output metrics_v1.json
glassalpha inspect --audit report_v2.pdf --output metrics_v2.json

# Compare
diff metrics_v1.json metrics_v2.json
```

Document changes in cover letter to regulator.

## Best Practices

### Documentation Hygiene

- Store evidence packs in tamper-evident storage (write-once, append-only)
- Version all policy gate configurations (track changes over time)
- Archive audits with date and model version in filename
- Maintain registry of all audits for portfolio-level tracking

### Reproducibility

- Always run audits in strict mode for regulator submissions
- Verify evidence pack integrity before submission
- Include verification instructions for independent validators
- Document any deviations from standard policy gates

### Regulator Communication

- Use neutral, factual language (not marketing tone)
- Cite specific regulatory clauses for all requirements
- Provide confidence intervals and sample sizes for metrics
- Document limitations and assumptions clearly
- Include contact information for technical questions

### Policy Gate Governance

- Review and update policy thresholds annually
- Document rationale for all threshold values
- Track gate failures across model portfolio
- Require executive approval for policy exceptions

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Evidence pack verification fails

**Symptom**: `glassalpha verify-evidence-pack` reports checksum mismatch

**Causes**:

- File was modified after evidence pack creation
- Incorrect file uploaded (wrong version)
- Transmission corruption

**Resolution**:

- Regenerate evidence pack from source audit
- Verify file integrity with `sha256sum <file>`
- Use secure transfer method (SFTP, not email)

### Issue: Policy gate failure near threshold

**Symptom**: Metric is 0.102, threshold is 0.10 (just over)

**Investigation**:

- Check confidence interval (does it overlap threshold?)
- Check sample size (is difference statistically significant?)
- Review trend over time (improving or degrading?)

**Options**:

- If CI overlaps threshold: Document uncertainty, monitor
- If significant: Remediate
- If improving trend: Request waiver with monitoring plan

### Issue: Regulator questions reproducibility

**Symptom**: Regulator asks "How do I know these results are accurate?"

**Response**:

- Provide evidence pack with checksums
- Offer to reproduce audit in front of regulator (deterministic)
- Share provenance manifest showing all seeds, versions, hashes
- Reference open-source tool (code is auditable)
- Provide verification instructions
