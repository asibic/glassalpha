**Key stages:**

1. **Configuration** - Define model, data, protected attributes, policy gates
2. **Execution** - Run audit with `--strict` mode for regulatory compliance
3. **Review** - Analyze results, address failed gates, document warnings
4. **Evidence** - Export tamper-evident evidence pack with checksums
5. **Validation** - Independent review by validator or compliance officer
6. **Submission** - Submit to regulator with cover letter and verification instructions
7. **Archive** - Retain all artifacts per regulatory requirements (typically 7 years)

### Multi-Jurisdiction Scenarios

**Example 1: US Bank with EU Customers**

- Primary: SR 11-7 (US banking)
- Secondary: GDPR Article 22 (EU customers)
- **Solution**: Run audit with both `financial_services` and `eu_ai_act` profiles

**Example 2: Insurance Company (Multi-State)**

- Primary: NAIC Model #870 (all states)
- State-Specific: California SB 221, Colorado SB21-169
- **Solution**: Use `insurance` profile + state-specific fairness thresholds

**Example 3: Healthcare AI (Clinical Decision Support)**

- Primary: HIPAA (data protection)
- Secondary: 21st Century Cures Act (clinical validation)
- **Solution**: De-identify data, use `healthcare` profile, supplement with clinical validation

### Determining Your Requirements

1. **Geography**: Where are your users located?
2. **Industry**: Which sector are you operating in?
3. **Use Case**: What decisions does your model make?
4. **Data Sensitivity**: Do you handle protected data (PHI, PII)?
5. **Impact**: What are the consequences of model errors?

**Not sure?** Start with the [Compliance Readiness Checklist](compliance-readiness-checklist.md) to identify your requirements.
