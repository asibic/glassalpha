# Credit Card Fraud Detection Configuration
# Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection (Kaggle)
# Task: Detect fraudulent transactions in anonymized credit card data
# Class Distribution: Highly imbalanced (~0.17% fraud)
# Size: 284,807 transactions
# Source: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
#
# Features: V1-V28 (PCA-transformed), Time, Amount
# Target: Class (1=fraud, 0=legitimate)
#
# Note: Due to PCA transformation, features are not directly interpretable.
# SHAP values show relative importance of transformed features.

  # No traditional protected attributes (features are anonymized via PCA)

  # Important: Handle class imbalance
  # - Consider stratified sampling for SHAP
  # - May want to undersample majority class for fairness metrics

metrics:
  performance:
    metrics:
      - accuracy # Not very useful for imbalanced data
      - precision # Critical: % of flagged transactions that are fraud
      - recall # Critical: % of fraud caught
      - f1 # Harmonic mean of precision/recall
      - auc_roc # Area under ROC curve

  # Threshold analysis is critical for fraud detection:
  # - High threshold: Fewer false positives, more false negatives
  # - Low threshold: More false positives, fewer false negatives
  # - Balance based on business cost of false positives vs false negatives

  fairness:
    metrics: []
    # Limited fairness analysis due to anonymized features
    # If you have demographic data, add:
    # - demographic_parity
    # - equal_opportunity

# Fraud Detection Specific Considerations:
#
# 1. Class Imbalance (~0.17% fraud):
#    - Use scale_pos_weight or class_weight
#    - Focus on precision/recall, not accuracy
#    - Consider PR-AUC over ROC-AUC
#
# 2. Business Costs:
#    - False Positive: Decline legitimate transaction (customer frustration)
#    - False Negative: Miss fraud (financial loss)
#    - Optimize threshold based on cost ratio
#
# 3. Feature Interpretation:
#    - V1-V28 are PCA components (not directly interpretable)
#    - Time: Seconds since first transaction
#    - Amount: Transaction amount in Euros
#    - SHAP shows which PCA components matter most
#
# 4. Model Selection:
#    - XGBoost/LightGBM: Best performance for fraud detection
#    - LogisticRegression: Faster but lower recall
#
# 5. Evaluation Metrics Priority:
#    - Recall (catch fraud): 80-90% target
#    - Precision (avoid false alarms): 10-30% typical
#    - F1 Score: Balance between precision/recall
#
# 6. Threshold Tuning:
#    # Example: Optimize for 90% recall
#    from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
#    precisions, recalls, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_pred_proba)
#    threshold_90_recall = thresholds[recalls >= 0.90][0]
#
# 7. Production Considerations:
#    - Real-time scoring requirements (<100ms)
#    - Model retraining frequency (fraud patterns evolve)
#    - Monitoring for concept drift
